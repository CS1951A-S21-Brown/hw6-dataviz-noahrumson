            The first graph shows the top 10 video games by sales in a user-given year. The second graph shows a pie chart of
            the video game sales in a user-given region broken down by genre. The third graph shows the publisher with the greatest
            median sales for each genre, excluding publishers with very few (< 5) games in that genre. These directly answer each
            of the questions given.

                    It made creating complicated graphics easy.

                    It provided routines for data manipulation, similar to pandas in Python.

                    Working in a web browser allows for easy debugging and fast prototyping.

                    It caused memory leaks in my browser which made me have to terminate it every once in a while.

                    I get the sense that it stores and operates on data in a very inefficient way, making it a poor choice in case one wants
                    to do a lot of processing.

                    If you don't need very complicated figures then there are simpler tools available.

            The colors in the pie chart are hard to distinguish from each other so this would not be easy for someone who is poor at discriminating colors.
            There is also no audio option so it is not accessible to people who cannot see. It would be possible to add audio functionality so that those
            people could use the dashboard. Like the reading says however, using text is a good start since many computers are equipped with functionality
            to convert text to audio. Similarly it should be possible to find better colors that work for the pie chart.

            I could not find an extensible way to get 12+ colors for a pie chart that are easily distringuishable. This is because I figured hardcoding them
            would not be a great way in case you wanted to add more genres in the future. Also when you get down to it there really aren't that many colors.
